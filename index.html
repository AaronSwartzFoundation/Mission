      <h1>Science is a Human Right</h1>
      <h2 />
      <p>
        In Article 27 of the Declaration of Human Rights it states in the first
        part that "Everyone has the right to freely share in the benefits of
        scientific advancement." Which is absolutely true and essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it builds on the previous Article 26 where it states that "Everyone
        has the right to education." And because scientific articles are the
        main source and only reliable source of human knowledge their reclusive
        existence behind privately owned company paywalls represents a breach of
        these human rights. On two accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let this sink in for a moment: The reclusive existence of scientific
        articles and their findings behind privately owned company paywalls
        represents a breach of human rights on two accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that the accusations against Aaron Swartz and the raising of
        his expected punishment from a year to thirty one years (which is above
        life sentence where I come from) for his treacherous crime of attempting 
        to have two human rights become reality for everyone with internet access 
        was in and of itself a crime against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        To even intend to dole out a sentence that is equivalent to the death
        penalty which in our country is considered murder is an act so
        incredulous it makes your hair stand up. But the fact that Aaron, upon
        knowing these insane intentions, killed himself, amounts to nothing less
        than man slaughter by neglecting not only his but all humans rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hearby call for the immediate efforts to make all human knowledge in
        the form of all published scientific papers not only illegally but very
        much legally accessible for everyone by invoking the most basic of all
        laws that exist: The Declaration of Human Rights where it states that all
        people shall have free access to sciences fruits and education.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there shall be taken measures to move in front of the supreme
        court in this matter we shall also work on the implementation of a
        foundation that is dedicated to the realisation of these two
        quintessential human rights. Quintessential for human self realisation
        and thriving.
      </p>
      <p>I propose the name of this foundation to be:</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <h2>The Aaron Swartz Foundation</h2>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It shall strive to implement an open-source platform for scientists
        around the world to publish their findings, to review other scientists
        work, to repeat it and to publicly make available their raw data live
        while it is created in the lab.
